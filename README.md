# Getting Started

This taskmanager is used to run processes from the backend.

Ask a team member for the current version of the `.env` file.

Put this file in the root folder of this repository (arena-backend) and check that the `.env` file contains the necessary information for the database, endpoints and keys.

This project uses [`Prettier`](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting, please set up your editor accordingly.

Run task_manager with:

```bash
python3 task_manager.py
```

See if tasks are running in docker with:

```bash
docker ps -a
```
